Vim Exercises
=============

These exercises are meant to be used alongside vimtutor, in order to
get more practice with the commands taught. Open vimtutor in one instance
of Vim, and `vim_ex.txt` in another instance. Most lessons in vimtutor
will have an equivalent exercise in `vim_ex.txt`, except for those where
it doesn't really make sense to have a separate exercise.
